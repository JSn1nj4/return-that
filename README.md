# Return That

Ever get tired of people not returning what they borrowed? _Ever realize you're that person and cringe_?

### This might be for you!

This is a standalone borrowed-item database to keep track of things you borrowed, who you borrowed it from, and when!

_It might also be an excuse to try [filament](https://filamentphp.com/)..._

## Primary Features

- None...for now!

This primary feature right now is that it's under development, so it has no features! But you're welcome to poke around while it's being worked on.

## Future ideas

This is a brainstorming list of features that might sound nice and may never actually get implemented.

- First-time setup wizard
- Configurable alerts to annoy the life out of you until you **give it back you hoarder**
- Multi-user support (within the same household)
- Multi-household (multitenant) support for people/households that can stand each other
  - Actually, this might create unnecessary friction, so I'm going to leave it here for giggles only
- Configurable backup scheduler with support for...
  - local disk
  - SSH/SFTP server
  - Amazon S3
